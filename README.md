This is my repository for circuits I designed (or coppied/modded). All of
them are powered by 9V single supply. Bypassing circuit is omitted (a
true bypass using a 3PDT should do it). The designs are constrained by
the availability of components in my area (which is less than I would
like). As a result, expect lots of homemade Vactrols and no JFETs.
