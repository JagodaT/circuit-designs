Simple tremolo circuit using LDR's. Besides amplitude modulation, there's an one pole low pass filter modulation in tandem.
LFO is a relaxation oscillator, with "triangle" (more like a sharktooth) and square outputs. The second LED in the BJT collector is used as a "rate" indicator. The trimpot is used to bias the BJT in its "sweetspot", which may vary depending on the LED/LDR used.
